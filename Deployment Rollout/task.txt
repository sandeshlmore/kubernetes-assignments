Run an nginx pod, upgrade the image tag to (latest-not-available) that would break the pod. 
Now rollback that upgrade to revert the changes.
Hint: Use rollout to see and revert the changes.


kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx 

kubectl set image deployment nginx nginx=niginx:latest-not-available

kubectl rollout undo deployment nginx --to-revision=1
